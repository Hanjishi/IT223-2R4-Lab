    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm John Dalisay, an IT student learning various IT-related courses as part of my school's curriculum.  
    My journey involves learning about web development, design, and other essential aspects of technology.</p>

    <p>Although I am still in the process of honing my web development skills, I aim to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications in the future. I am currently focused on building a strong foundation in HTML, Python, and Java, .</p>

    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy reading manhua/comics and playing MOBA games, which fuel my creativity and problem-solving abilities. These hobbies help me develop a fresh perspective on design and interaction.</p>

    <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about me on the About page.
