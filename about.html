    <p>I'm John Dalisay, a 20-year-old IT student currently enrolled in IT2R4, with a deep interest in web development and design.</p>

    <p>My journey in the IT world began with a fascination for technology and a desire to understand how websites and applications work. Although I am still in the process of honing my skills in web development, I am actively learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design principles. I aim to improve my skills and create functional, user-friendly web applications.</p>

    <p>As an aspiring web developer, my focus is on creating responsive and user-centered web applications that are both functional and visually appealing. While I am still learning, I strive to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to any projects I take on.</p>

    <p>In addition to my studies, I enjoy reading manhua/comics and playing MOBA games, which fuel my creativity and help me develop my problem-solving abilities. These hobbies complement my technical background by giving me fresh perspectives on design and interaction.</p>
